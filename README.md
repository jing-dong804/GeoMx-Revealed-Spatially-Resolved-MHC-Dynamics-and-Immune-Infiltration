# Spatially Resolved MHC Dynamics and Immune Infiltration as Biomarkers for Immunotherapy Response in Melanoma

This repository contains the R code used for analyses in the manuscript:  
**"Spatially Resolved MHC Dynamics and Immune Infiltration as Biomarkers for Immunotherapy Response in Melanoma"**.

All scripts and functions provided here reproduce the main computational analyses, including:
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Compartment-specific pathway activity inference (GSEA)
- Immune infiltration analysis: CIBERSORT deconvolution and signature-based analysis
- Multi-region aggregations
- Integrated random forest models
- Statistical tests
